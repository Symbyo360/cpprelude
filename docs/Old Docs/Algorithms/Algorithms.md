# Algorithms

**CPPrelude** provide also a collection of functions under the header file algorithms.

Here's a list of these functions:

| Name                                | Description                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [is_sorted](is_sorted.md)           | a function that checks whether this sequence of elements is sorted ascending or descending or according to the `Comparator` parameter. |
| [shuffle](shuffle.md)               | a function that randomly rearrange elements. |
| [insertion_sort](insertion_sort.md) | a function that applies insertion sort algorithm for sorting. |
| [merge_sort](merge_sort.md)         | a function that applies merge sort algorithm for sorting. |
| [quick_sort](quick_sort.md)         | a function that applies 3-way quick sort algorithm for sorting. |
| [heap_sort](heap_sort.md)           | a function that applies heap sort algorithm for sorting. |
| [quick_select](quick_select.md)     | A function that finds the k-th ordered element in a list without actually sorting the entire list. |
